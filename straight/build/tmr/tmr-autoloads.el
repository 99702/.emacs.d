(autoload 'tmr "tmr" "\
Set timer to TIME duration and notify after it elapses.

When TIME is a number, it is interpreted as a count of minutes.
Otherwise TIME must be a string that consists of a number and a
special final character denoting a unit of time: h for hours, s
for seconds.

With optional DESCRIPTION as a prefix (\\[universal-argument]),
prompt for a description among `tmr-description-list', though
allow for any string to serve as valid input.

With optional ACKNOWLEDGEP non-nil the timer must be acknowledged
after it finished, such that the timer cannot be missed.

This command also plays back `tmr-sound-file' if it is available.

To cancel the timer, use the `tmr-cancel' command.

To always prompt for a DESCRIPTION when setting a timer, use the
command `tmr-with-details' instead of this one.

(fn TIME &optional DESCRIPTION ACKNOWLEDGEP)" t)
(autoload 'tmr-with-details "tmr" "\
Set timer to TIME duration and notify after it elapses.

See `tmr' for a description of the arguments DESCRIPTION and
ACKNOWLEDGEP.  The difference between the two commands is that
`tmr-with-details' always asks for a description and if the timer
should be acknowledged whereas `tmr' only asks for it when the
user uses a prefix argument (\\[universal-argument]).
